# Aardwolf

### Powerful, Social, Connected Communities With Free Software

Aardwolf is a platform for creating new social networks, connected across the web. While existing social media sites work to funnel the world into a single shared experience (and advertising marketplace), we recognize that we are all individuals with different identities and interests.

**Aardwolf is the engine behind a new Facebook-like social platform, our first -planned- instance of the engine will be hosted on [wearesocial.space](http://wearesocial.space).**

Aardwolf shares a philosophy and underlying protocols with [Mastodon](http://joinmastodon.org), a federated microblogging platform with over a 1000 independently-run servers, hosting more than one million active users.


### What's Different About Aardwolf?

Aardwolf is a social platform, meaning that each server hosts its own community of users who are posting, sharing pictures, links, etc. They are replying and “liking” each other’s posts, and re-sharing the ones they like best.

Even better, Aardwolf is a *connected* (the technical term is “federated”) platform: users are not limited to only interacting with other users on their service: they can follow users on other sites that are powered by Aardwolf just as if they were on their own site. They can even connect with users on other platforms, if -- like the microblogging service [Mastodon](http://joinmastodon.org) -- they implement the same free protocols Aardwolf is built on.

Finally, Aardwolf is [free software](https://github.com/banjofox/aardwolf), so developers who want to contribute or understand how it works can dig in and do so.


### Project Status

The scaffolding is still being built, but the pieces are coming together much quicker than originally anticipated! A sample of the web interface should be online soon.


### Contact Us / Getting Help
Lately we have been hanging out on Matrix chat which is [#aardwolf-discussion:matrix.org](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#aardwolf-discussion:matrix.org), and doing almost all of our discussion there.

We also have a forum [WeAreSocial.tech](http://wearesocial.tech/) (you can login with your GitHub account), and a [mailing list](https://lists.riseup.net/www/info/aardwolf-development), both of which have been super quiet. 

Also if you ned specific help on something or simply don't feel like setting up your own environment reach out to Banjo, and he will **build a VM** for you! If you need it to be Windows please make sure that you have a -legal- licence for it ;)

### Donating to the cause

For those who would prefer to help us in a monetary fashion you may do so here: [liberapay.com/Aardwolf](https://liberapay.com/Aardwolf)
Please do not be afraid to ask questions. There are a lot of things that Banjo would appreciate help with. Even if you do not know Rust, there may be other ways to participate! :D
