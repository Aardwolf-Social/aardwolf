### About
Aardwolf is a social networking app which aims to provide the features of Facebook while respecting user privacy. Unlike mainstream social media sites that work to funnel the world into a single (advertising-filled) shared experience, we recognize that individuals with different identities and interests.  

Our vision is to create a social-networking platform that is easy to mirrors the functionality of Facebook while also considering the needs of the community.  We hope to be one of many federated applications working towards a better, friendlier, social Internet.
