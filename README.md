# Fedibook
A macroblogging companion to Mastodon (a **free, open-source social network server**). Designed from the ground-up with **privacy, security, and freedom** in mind. Our goals is to be fully-compatible with Mastodon, while adding functionalities seen in other popular social media sites. Decentralizing the system means that anyone can build, and customize, their own server instance thereby granting them greater control over content. Instances can then be connected to one another (federated) thus allowing users on one instance to interact with individuals on another. The more federation , the wider the user-base becomes. 

The back-end is built on **Rust** with **Rocket**. Currently we are using Bulma as our SASS/CSS Framework, and have considered Intercooler.js for the other parts of the Front-End.

### Contributing
If you would like to give us a hand that would be awesome! :D 
Right now, we need a bit of everythig, and I am trying to create issues/milestones accordingly. Please take a look around the project, and see what you might want to work on. Even the documentation/wiki needs help. Grab a fork, and start hacking away :D

Banjo is the official "public" face of the project, so it is perhaps best if you reach out to him.<br />
