  Aardwolf, building social communities with open software.

### About
Aardwolf is a platform for creating new social networks, connected across the web. While existing social media sites work to funnel the world into a single shared experience (and advertising marketplace), we recognize that we are all individuals with different identities and interests. 

Our vision is to create a social-networking platform that mirrors the functionality of Facebook while also considering the needs of the community.  We hope to be one of many federated applications working towards a better, friendlier, social Internet.

###  Contributing
As a COMMUNITY it is very important to us that we maintain a positive and supportive environment for everyone who wants to participate. When you join us we ask that you follow our [code of conduct](/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) in all interactions both on and offline.

Here are the areas we could use help with!
_ProTip: Working on a project is a great way to learn programming ;)_

* Rust Developers, folk that want to learn are welcome! - [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) 
* Frontend Developers, HTML/CSS folks that want to help with the [Aardwolf Interface](https://github.com/Aardwolf-Social/aardwolf-interface)
* Documentation help.  Proofreading, organization, update wiki, etc.
* Docker containers/VM's.  Some progress has been made building Docker images (for developement)
* PostgreSQL database admins.  Since Postgres is our current DB of choice, it'd be nice to make sure that we're doing things right ;)
