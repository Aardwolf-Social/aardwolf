Fedibook is a macroblogging companion to Mastodon (a **free, open-source social network server**). Designed from the ground-up with **privacy, security, and freedom** in mind. Our goals is to be fully-compatible with Mastodon, while adding functionalities seen in other popular social media sites. Decentralizing the system means that anyone can build, and customize, their own server instance thereby granting them greater control over content. Instances can then be connected to one another (federated) thus allowing users on one instance to interact with individuals on another. The more federation , the wider the user-base becomes. 

The back-end is built on **Rust**, while the front-end/UI is written in **HTML5 & COMPASS/SASS**.
