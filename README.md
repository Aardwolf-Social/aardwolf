### About Aardwolf

Aardwolf is a platform for creating new social networks, connected across the web. While existing social media sites work to funnel the world into a single shared experience (and advertising marketplace), we recognize that we are all individuals with different identities and interests. 

Our vision is to create a social-networking platform that mirrors the functionality of Facebook while also considering the needs of the community.  We hope to be one of many federated applications working towards a better, friendlier, social Internet.

### What is Different About Aardwolf?

Aardwolf is a social platform, meaning that each server hosts its own community of users who are posting, sharing pictures, links, etc. They are replying and “liking” each other’s posts, and re-sharing the ones they like best.

Even better, Aardwolf is a *connected* (the technical term is “federated”) platform: users are not limited to only interacting with other users on their service: they can follow users on other sites that are powered by Aardwolf just as if they were on their own site. They can even connect with users on other platforms, if -- like the microblogging service [Mastodon](http://joinmastodon.org) -- they implement the same free protocols Aardwolf is built on.

Finally, Aardwolf is [free software](https://github.com/banjofox/aardwolf), so developers who want to contribute or understand how it works can dig in and do so.


### Project Status

The scaffolding is still being built, but the pieces are coming together much quicker than originally anticipated! A sample of the web interface should be online soon.  There are many ways for folks to contribute

### Contact Us
Lately we have been hanging out on Matrix chat which is [#aardwolf-discussion:matrix.org](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#aardwolf-discussion:matrix.org), and doing almost all of our discussion there.

We also have a forum [WeAreSocial.tech](http://wearesocial.tech/) (you can login with your GitHub account), and a [mailing list](https://lists.riseup.net/www/info/aardwolf-development), both of which have been super quiet. 

If you would like to get in touch with the project lead (Banjo), please checkout his homepage at [banjo.codes](http://banjo.codes) for a detailed list of contact methods. 

### Getting Help
Please feel free to use any of the contact methods as listed above.  Someone will gladly provide assistance, or answer questions that you may have regarding the project.
