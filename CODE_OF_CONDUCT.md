# The Aardwolf Project Code of Conduct

## Conduct

* We are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of level of experience, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, nationality, or other similar characteristic.
* Participate in an authentic and active way. In doing so, you contribute to the health and longevity of this community.
* Please be kind and courteous. There’s no need to be mean or rude.
* Respect that people have differences of opinion and that every design or implementation choice carries a trade-off and numerous costs. There is seldom a right answer.
* Please keep unstructured critique to a minimum. If you have solid ideas you want to experiment with, make a fork and see how it works.
* We will exclude you from interaction if you insult, demean or harass anyone. That is not welcome behaviour. We specifically do not tolerate behavior that excludes people in socially marginalized groups.
* Private harassment is also unacceptable. No matter who you are, if you feel you have been or are being harassed or made uncomfortable by a community member, please contact a member of of the development team immediately. Whether you’re a regular contributor or a newcomer, we care about making this community a safe place for you and we’ve got your back.
* Likewise any spamming, trolling, flaming, baiting or other attention-stealing behaviour is not welcome.
* We interpret the term “harassment” as outlined in the [Citizen Code of Conduct](http://citizencodeofconduct.org/) under Unacceptable Behaviors, including the following: violence; threats of violence or violent language directed against another person; sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language; posting or displaying sexually explicit or violent material; posting or threatening to post other people’s personally identifying information (“doxing”); personal insults, particularly those related to marginalized identities; inappropriate photography or recording; unwelcome sexual attention, including sexualized comments or jokes, inappropriate touching, groping, and unwelcomed sexual advances; deliberate intimidation, stalking or following (online or in person); advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior; sustained disruption of discussions or collaborations.

## Moderation

These are the policies for upholding our community’s standards of conduct. If you feel that a thread needs moderation, please contact a member of [the development team](https://github.com/BanjoFox/aardwolf/wiki/Contributors). These policies apply to any mediums used for the project development communications, including but not limited to [Github](https://github.com/BanjoFox/Aardwolf), [#aardwolf-discussion:matrix.org](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#aardwolf-discussion:matrix.org), [the `aardwolf-development` mailing list](https://lists.riseup.net/www/info/aardwolf-development), and [the discussion forum](http://wearesocial.tech/).

1. Remarks that violate standards of conduct, including hateful, hurtful, oppressive, or exclusionary remarks, are not allowed. (Cursing is allowed, but never targeting another user, and never in a hateful manner.)
2. Remarks that moderators find inappropriate, whether listed in the code of conduct or not, are also not allowed.
3. Moderators will first respond to such remarks with a warning.
4. If the warning is unheeded, the user will be “kicked”, i.e., kicked out of the communication channel to cool off.
5. If the user comes back and continues to make trouble, they will be banned, i.e., indefinitely excluded.
6. Moderators may choose at their discretion to un-ban the user if it was a first offense and they offer the offended party a genuine apology.
7. If a moderator bans someone and you think it was unjustified, please take it up with that moderator, or with a different moderator, **in private**. Public complaints about bans are not allowed.
8. Moderators are held to a higher standard than other community members. If a moderator creates an inappropriate situation, they should expect less leeway than others.

In this community we strive to go the extra step to look out for each other. Don’t just aim to be technically unimpeachable, try to be your best self. In particular, avoid being flippant with offensive or sensitive issues, particularly if they’re off-topic; this all too often leads to unnecessary fights, hurt feelings, and damaged trust; worse, it can drive people away from the community entirely.

And if someone takes issue with something you said or did, resist the urge to be defensive. Just stop doing it and apologize. Even if you feel you were misinterpreted or unfairly accused, chances are good there was something you could’ve communicated better — remember that it’s your responsibility to make your fellow community members comfortable. Everyone wants to get along and we are all here first and foremost because we want to build a great project. You will find that people will be eager to assume good intent and forgive as long as you earn their trust.
