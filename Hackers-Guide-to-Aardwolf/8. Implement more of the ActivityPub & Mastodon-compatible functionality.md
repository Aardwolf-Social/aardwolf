##8. Implement more of the ActivityPub & Mastodon-compatible functionality.

Unfortunately this is a very... undefined floating target however I will do my best to at least point out the trail heads.
These bullet points are generally going to follow order of operations as they make sense in my head.

 - Build a "map" of the -existing- Mastodon functionality.
 - Build a "map" of the full ActivityPub specification 
 - Find common links between Mastodon map, and ActivityPub map
 - Translate the parts common to ActivityPub & Mastodon into pseudocode.  Getting it CLOSE to Rust would be great when possible
 - Take remaining parts of the ActivityPub spec, and pseudocode those
 - Try to come up with a list of additional functional targets which are missing/poorly defined/not covered by ActivityPub
