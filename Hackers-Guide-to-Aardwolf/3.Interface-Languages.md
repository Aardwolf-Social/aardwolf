## 3.  Tying Languages to Templates

Head on over to [Issue #99](https://github.com/BanjoFox/aardwolf/issues/99) where you can discuss this further and contribute your help.

The web interface for the application follows the [Tera](https://github.com/Keats/tera) syntax for populating the content.  Rocket can use several template formats, however Tera was written specifically for Rust.  Previous versions of Aardwolf templates used the Handlebars format, which is more geared toward JavaScript users.  One point of interest is that the Handlebars templates rendered, and simply rendered the variable names.  However, Tera compiles but throws an error during runtime because the variables are not, yet, tied to specific value.

The language files live inside of /lang, and are simple key=value pairs using the [TOML](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml) syntax.  When the app loads it should scan the /lang directory to ensure that at least one valid language file is present.  All of the key=value pairs in the language files are stored in a struct (/src/aardwolf/lang.rs) that is used to parse the files more efficiently.  Currently there are two places where the language files can be configured.  The main aardwolf.toml, and the user preferences dropdown.

This feature is being tracked in the a-i18n-langages* branch: Shortcut here --> [a-i18n-langages](https://github.com/BanjoFox/aardwolf/tree/a-i18n-langages)
