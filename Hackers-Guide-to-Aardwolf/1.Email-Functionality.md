## 1.  E-mail Functionality

Ideally, Aardwolf will be able to send SMTP messages without having to resort to an external mailer daemon (Postfix, Sendmail, Etc).  There are several libraries on [Crates.io](https://crates.io), such as Mailstrom, and Lettre, that should be able to provide this functionality.  E-mails received should include the full URL in both clickable, and plain text (copy/paste) format.  Using a basic template for formatting would be ideal, but is not required for the minimum viable alpha release.

*Current State*
Currently when a user creates an account, the auth_token is generated, and sent to STDOUT.  This means that someone has to log into the server occasionally, and manually copy/paste the auth_token URL's in order to authorize new accounts.  

-- Do we want SMTP functionality to be "outbound only".  
-- Is there a reason why we might need to receive e-mails?
