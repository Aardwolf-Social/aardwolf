# Welcome Future Contributor!
Our vision is to create a social-networking platform that mirrors the functionality of Facebook while also considering the needs of the community.  We hope to be one of many federated applications working towards a better, friendlier, social Internet.

We welcome help from technical, as well as non-technical folks equally.  Even if you do not code, there is a growing list of items that you may still be able to help out with. <br />

Please do not hesitate to ask questions, or volunteer for things that you might be interested in poking at.
Also checkout the [Developer Documentation](https://github.com/Aardwolf-Social/aardwolf/tree/documentation-rework/doc/development)For more information on specific development targets.
