# Welcome Future Contributor!
Our vision is to create a social-networking platform that mirrors the functionality of Facebook while also considering the needs of the community.  We hope to be one of many federated applications working towards a better, friendlier, social Internet.

We welcome help from technical, as well as non-technical equally.  Even if you do not code, there is a growing list of items that you may still be able to help out with.
Please do not hesitate to ask questions, or volunteer for things that you might be interested in poking at.
