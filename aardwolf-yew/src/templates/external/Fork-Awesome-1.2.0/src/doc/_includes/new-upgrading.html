  <h2 class="page-header">Switching from {{ site.fontawesome.name }} {{ site.fontawesome.minor_version }}?</h2>
  <p>
    If you were using {{ site.fontawesome.name }} {{ site.fontawesome.minor_version }}, you should be able to just switch to {{ site.forkawesome.name }} {{ site.forkawesome.minor_version }} and get all the benefits from it.
    If you were using npm or composer packages, replace the ones you were using by this {{ site.forkawesome.name }} ones. Or if you downloaded a static copy of {{ site.fontawesome.name }}, download the latest version of {{ site.forkawesome.name }} and
    replace CSS and font files in your project and you should be good to go.
  </p>
  <p>
    We paid special attention not to change unicode codepoints for the existing icons, nor changed the CSS class names or icon names from {{ site.fontawesome.name }} {{ site.fontawesome.minor_version }}.
    Though we added a few more icons and made the process of contributing to this project much easier.
    Though, if you see a mistake, please don't hesitate to <a href="{{ page.relative_path }}community/#reporting-bugs">file a bug</a>.
