## 1.  E-mail Functionality

Head on over to [Issue #97](https://github.com/BanjoFox/aardwolf/issues/97) where you can discuss this further and contribute your help.

Ideally, Aardwolf will be able to send SMTP messages without having to resort to an external mailer daemon (Postfix, Sendmail, Etc).  There are several libraries on [Crates.io](https://crates.io), such as Mailstrom, and Lettre, that should be able to provide this functionality.  E-mails received should include the full URL in both clickable, and plain text (copy/paste) format.  Using a basic template for formatting would be ideal, but is not required for the minimum viable alpha release.

*Current State*
Currently when a user creates an account, the auth_token is generated, and sent to STDOUT.  This means that someone has to log into the server occasionally, and manually copy/paste the auth_token URL's in order to authorize new accounts.  

-- Do we want SMTP functionality to be "outbound only".  
-- Is there a reason why we might need to receive e-mails?
