## 6. API Development

Head on over to [Issue #102](https://github.com/BanjoFox/aardwolf/issues/102) where you can discuss this further and contribute your help.

The HTML/CSS parts (front-end) will need to interact with the Rust/Server-side components.  My understanding is that this will be done through an Application Programming Interface.

Our current lean is toward developing a Representational State Transfer (REST) API.  Unfortunately I am not knowledgable enough to speak on this however there is a [REST API Tutorial](http://www.restapitutorial.com/) that I am working through.  

In terms of Aardwolf, there is a LOT to be discussed.  So if you are interested in REST APIs, even if you have never -built- one feel free to speak up.  Even folks with zero experience might raise useful questions.
