## 2.  Documentation Review

Head on over to [Issue #98](https://github.com/BanjoFox/aardwolf/issues/98) where you can discuss this further and contribute your help.

Existing documentation should be reviewed for clarity, and correctness.  There may be other portions of documentation which can be improved by being re-written, or re-organized.  Other parts of the application are currently poorly or entirely undocumented at this time.
