## 7. Implementing more I/O to create a local timeline

Head on over to [Issue #103](https://github.com/BanjoFox/aardwolf/issues/103) where you can discuss this further and contribute your help.

Part of the minimal viable product (MVP) is to get a live demo that has a "shoutbox-like" functionality.  This means that users can log in, and create posts to a single local timeline.  Doing so will minimally prove the concept, as well as fullfilling the need for a local timeline. 

Being able to tag other users, would be nice, but would require the interface to have a way to notify users (after login) that they have been tagged.  One possible "stretch goal" for this target is to implement user profiles, including avatars (file-size limited due to server disk space limits).
