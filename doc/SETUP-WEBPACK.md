# INTRODUCTION

Rather than including full packages for application/web styling (Bulma.io, ForkAwesome, etc) we are using WebPack.  
The alternative would be to simply include CDN links (ex: https://bulma.io/path/to/bulma-min.css), however there may 
be folks that would prefer to have local copies of everything. 

This document will describe how to use WebPack

(( These instructions don't work yet :D --Placeholder ))
```
# sudo apt install npm nodejs
# npm install 
# npm run build
```
